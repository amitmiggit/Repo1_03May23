PBIS Version Update Test and Integration Servers

This is just an information for all server owners.

The activity is required as the issue is regarding PBIS credential login. 

This is an online activity which would not impact any servers. We would only install the latest version of PBIS on each server

1)Please set the downtime on the PBIS/ADclient check service on for the servers you are going to do 
you can use the bellow command to set down time there is also documentation about downtime in Nagios here 4.9 Downtime in Nagios

Set the downtime for the service "os_linux_default_check_adclient " for all the servers as per the attached list

For example as below:
downtime -a -h 2 -c "Pieter upgrading PBIS" -s os_linux_default_check_adclient <server list>

2)The PBIS_UPGRADE.yaml can be found under the normal place /global/instserv/ansible/playbooks

ansiblectl apply --playbook=PBIS_UPGRADE.yaml --hostlist=server_list

Note - Ansible Playbook has to be executed from the respective install server

3) Validation: 
   Afterwards you will go to all the logs under  "/global/instserv/logs/ansible/" file will be like "2020.04.08.16.25.14.q358439.ltrcpcs01.bmwgroup.net.log" on each install server and see how many "failed=1" there are.
and investigate why there were failures. 

Please don't forget to do your PBIS and Thruk check during the process.
