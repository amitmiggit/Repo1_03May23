Hello Team, 

it seems that lpascwui01 was not provisioned as intended about 1 year ago. 
As we just saw that this server has less RAM as the current application server (lpmodthk03).

Is there a way to increase the RAM on lpascwui01?

Thanks a lot and Best Regards,

Hi Jennifer,

Yes we can extend the RAM but we have two prerequisute for that 
1.We need BMW BU responsible approval which you can find after droping a mail to DL linux-operating@list.bmw.com
2.We need downtime for the increase of RAM and a task is required for that with the template as below:
