Hello Team,

We have error 7654 on the following servers on NetBackup MASTER server lp02nb3master.w2:

li02sarmove22vmb.bmwgroup.net
li02sarmove41vmb.bmwgroup.net
li02sarmove42vmb.bmwgroup.net
lp02pga03778vmb.bmwgroup.net



taipsow2.w2(package) = LT02IPSO13VM(hostname)

The system is currently unable to communicate with the NetBackup Servers because if a missing SSL certificate.

Please use the following Token FSEBQHZTMZQJXKKO and run these commands as Administrator/root:

Unix:   /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/nbcertcmd

nbcertcmd -getCACertificate -server lp02nb3master.w2

nbcertcmd -getCertificate -host li02sarmove22vmb -server lp02nb3master -token FSEBQHZTMZQJXKKO -force

In the above command you should replace only hostname(using server fqdns in the list above) when you login on particular server.

In case that token doesn't work please try with the following one: WWEXBKYXPOUOIFQQ

Please contact me if you face any issues.

Thank you.
